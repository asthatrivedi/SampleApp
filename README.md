SampleApp
=========

Sample App is a customized Faceboook application which displays your facebook friends list on a table view. 
We display friends name and profile pictures in an alphabetical order. The Friends list also contains a search bar so
that you dont need to scroll down to find your friend. There is a detail view which displays your friends profile pic.

SDK features used:

1). Grand Central Dispatch for creating a background queue which gets images of all your frnds.
2). Facebook SDK to fetch facebook data. Facebook UI is not being used.
3). Storyboard for user interface.
4). NSPredicate for sorting the friends list in alphabetical order.


Future Enhancements:

1). Customizing login screen buttons using Core Graphics to add color and clipping the corner edges.
